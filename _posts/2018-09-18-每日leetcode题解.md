# LeetCode 71: Simplify Path

```python
#
# [71] Simplify Path

# Total Accepted:    124.7K
# Total Submissions: 461.5K
# Testcase Example:  '"/home/"'
#
# Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. 
# 
# For example,
# path = "/home/", => "/home"
# path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"
# path = "/a/../../b/../c//.//", => "/c"
# path = "/a//b////c/d//././/..", => "/a/b/c"
# 
# In a UNIX-style file system, a period ('.') refers to the current directory,
# so it can be ignored in a simplified path. Additionally, a double period
# ("..") moves up a directory, so it cancels out whatever the last directory
# was. For more information, look here:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#Unix_style
# 
# Corner Cases:
# 
# 
# Did you consider the case where path = "/../"?
# In this case, you should return "/".
# Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes '/' together,
# such as "/home//foo/".
# In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return "/home/foo".
# 


class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path):
        """
        :type path: str
        :rtype: str
        """

        path = path.split('/')
        stack = []
        jump = ('', '.', '..')
        for item in path:
            if stack and item == '..':
                stack.pop()
            elif item not in jump:
                stack.append(item)

        return '/' + '/'.join(stack)

```
